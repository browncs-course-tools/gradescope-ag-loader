# local-env.sh example
# This file contains environment variables required to run the
# autograder locally (ie, outside of gradescope).
#
# To use it:
# 1. MAKE A COPY of this file in the same directory as this
#    one and name it local-env.sh.
#
# 2. Update the paths of all variables to point to the respective
#    locations on your system.  Note that ALL PATHS SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE
#    PATHS, meaning they should start with a leading /
#    To find the absolute path for a directory on your system, use the
#    `realpath` command.
#
# Do not commit your local-env.sh to the repository, as it contains
# configurations specific to your system.  Every user should have
# their own version.
